# Dovahkiin
Hello and welcome to Dovahkiin! This modlist is currently a work in progress so I hope you forgive me as I am new to modding, but I will try my best to provide the best experience nonetheless :)

Description:

A modlist to overhaul and "freshen up" Skyrim while still keeping it true to itself. With the full Enairim suite and Legacy of the Dragonborn to boot, along with full Creation Club integration, done in a way where Bethesda's Creations don't break immersion, but enhance it. Embrace your destiny, Dragonborn!

Computer Spec Requirements:
  1. At least 8+ GB RAM
  2. GeForce RTX 2090 or higher
  3. Ryzen 5 or higher

Installation:
1. Install Wabbajack (duh) to a folder outside your "Program Files" folder
2. Create a folder outside your "Program Files" folder, name it "Dovahkiin" (it doesn't matter as long as you know which folder it is :))
3. Make sure your Steam Skyrim installation is outside the "Program Files" folder, preferably in your "Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition" folder
4. Make sure you have the latest x64 and x86 versions of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170
5. Make sure your PC is set to "Never" in your "device sleep" settings while downloading, just so that your PC doesn't go for a snooze while stuff's downloading, you can change this back after :)
6. Open Wabbajack
7. Select "Dovahkiin" from "Skyrim Special Edition"
8. Select your download folder
9. Install! It's that easy (hopefully!) :)
