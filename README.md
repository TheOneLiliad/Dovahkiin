# Dovahkiin
Hello and welcome to Dovahkiin! This modlist is currently a work in progress so I hope you forgive me as I am new to modding, but I will try my best to provide the best experience nonetheless :)

Description:

A modlist to overhaul and "freshen up" Skyrim while still keeping it true to itself. With the full Enairim suite and Legacy of the Dragonborn to boot, along with full Creation Club integration, done in a way where Bethesda's Creations don't break immersion, but enhance it. Embrace your destiny, Dragonborn!

Computer Spec Requirements:
  1. At least 8+ GB RAM
  2. GeForce RTX 2090 or higher
  3. Ryzen 5 or higher

Installation:
1. Create a folder outside your "Program Files" folder, name it "Dovahkiin" (it doesn't matter as long as you know which folder it is :))
2. Make sure your Steam Skyrim installation is outside the "Program Files" folder, preferably in your "Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition" folder
3. Make sure you have the latest x64 and x86 versions of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170
4. Make sure your PC is set to "Never" in your "device sleep" settings, just so that your PC doesn't go for a snooze while stuff's downloading, you can change this back after :)
5. Open Wabbajack
6. Select your download folder
7. Install! It's that easy (hopefully!) :)

Q&A:

"Will you be supporting this for the LE/VR version of Skyrim?" No.

"Does this work for the GOG version of Skyrim?" I don't know, haven't tested it.

"Do I have to have all the Creation Club Content installed?" Sadly, yes, it won't work without it.

"It's a bit messy currently" Well like I said, it's a work in progress. You don't develop skills overnight :)

"Will you add X mod?" If you want me to, please refer to the "Suggestions" tab.

"When will you update this?" Whenever I have the time to.

Please refer to the "Bugs" section to report bugs. Thank you :)
